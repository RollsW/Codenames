# Long-Cedar
A project codename generator. Super simple, super quick, suuuper sneaky...

The project holds three files, 
- adjectives.py (contains a single variable which is a gigantic list of adjectives) 
- nouns.py (contains a single variable which is a gigantic list of.... nouns) and 
- codegen.py which couples them together at random.

So you too can have projects named like this (though you might have to run it a few times to gets something <s>appropriate</s> not wholly inappropriate):
