# Long-Cedar
A project codename generator. Super simple, super quick, suuuper sneaky...

The project holds three files, 
- adjectives.py (contains a single variable which is a gigantic list of adjectives) 
- nouns.py (contains a single variable which is a gigantic list of.... nouns) and 
- codegen.py which couples them together at random.

So you too can have projects named like this (though you might have to run it a few times to gets something appropriate):

    left boxer
    worrying worry
    shrill airplane
    fantastic eye
    mild conclusion
    stale replacement
    due pollution
    busy airship
    mighty anime
    back sturgeon
    quick approval
    civilian wiseguy
    well hamburger
    overall patio
    amateur humour
    junior obesity
    weary bijou
    fond ask
    great hog
    generous rectangle

enjoy!
